# Elara Caring Phishing Attack


Back in 2020, US healthcare provider Elara Caring was subjected to a phishing attack that targeted two employees. The intruder then gained access to a limited number of Elara Caring email accounts and sent an additional phishing emails from two accounts. They gained access to including names, dates of birth, financial information, banking information, social security numbers, driver's license numbers and insurance information of more than 100,000 elderly patients.
Elara did a good work in mitigating this attack by changing passwords and denying access to the intruder as accounts were identified. But attackers were able to maintain unauthorized access to a week.
A type of Business Email Compromise(BEC) Which has impated many companies across the world and in the United States.

**How this could be prevented**
If Elara Caring had educated its employees on Phishing and different attack types, they couldve been able to recognise this attack and reported earlier before causing any harm. Its a good practice for an organization to educate their employees on phishing and social engineering attacks.
