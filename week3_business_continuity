# NA-014 – Business Impact Analysis 

## Key Metrics:
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: How fast you must recover
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: How much data loss is acceptable
- **MTTR**: Time to repair a failure
- **MTTF**: Avg time before failure (non-repairable)
- **MTBF**: Time between repeated failures (repairable systems)

## Example:
If your RTO is 2 hours, and MTTR is 4 hours → You’re not meeting your recovery objectives.

## Impact Types:
- **Life**
- **Safety**
- **Finance**
- **Reputation**
- **Property**

# NA-015 – Security Controls and Resilience

## High Availability Tactics:
- **RAID**: Drive redundancy
- **Failover**: Auto-switch to backup system
- **Load Balancing**: Split traffic to prevent overload
- **Clustering**: Redundant systems acting as one
- **Snapshots**: Instant restore point

## Backup Types:
- Full: Everything every time
- Incremental: Since last backup
- Differential: Since last full backup

## Site Types:
- Cold: Just building
- Warm: Hardware, no data
- Hot: Fully ready, live data sync
