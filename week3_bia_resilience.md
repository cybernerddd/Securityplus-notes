# NA-015 â€“ Security Controls and Resilience

## High Availability Tactics:
- **RAID**: Drive redundancy
- **Failover**: Auto-switch to backup system
- **Load Balancing**: Split traffic to prevent overload
- **Clustering**: Redundant systems acting as one
- **Snapshots**: Instant restore point

## Backup Types:
- Full: Everything every time
- Incremental: Since last backup
- Differential: Since last full backup

## Site Types:
- Cold: Just building
- Warm: Hardware, no data
- Hot: Fully ready, live data sync
