# Week 2 – Day 1: Network Devices & Segmentation

## Firewalls
- Packet Filtering: Inspects packets without memory.
- Stateful: Tracks active sessions.
- NGFW: Filters by apps, behaviors, malware.
- Host-based vs Network-based firewalls.

## IDS vs IPS
- IDS: Detects & alerts. Passive.
- IPS: Detects & blocks. Active.

## VPN
- Encrypts traffic over untrusted networks.
- Types: Site-to-Site, Remote Access.

## Proxy Servers
- Forward Proxy: Controls outbound traffic.
- Reverse Proxy: Hides backend servers.
- Application Proxy: Filters by app type.

## Segmentation
- VLANs: Logical separation of network traffic.
- DMZ: Public zone separated from internal systems.
- Air Gap: No physical connection to external networks.

## NA-006 – Using Risk Assessment Guides

- **Standards**: International security models (e.g., ISO, NIST).
- **Frameworks**: Structured approach to security (e.g., NIST CSF, COBIT).
- **Benchmarks**: Specific configuration rules (e.g., CIS Benchmarks).
- **Baselines**: Minimum acceptable security levels (e.g., strong passwords, firewall enabled).

## NA-007 – Security Control Types

### Nature of Control:
- **Administrative**: Policies and procedures (e.g., training users, hiring practices).
- **Technical**: Tech-based defense (e.g., antivirus, firewalls).
- **Physical**: Physical protection (e.g., doors, fences, guards).

### Functional Categories:
- **Preventive**: Stops threats (e.g., MFA, firewall).
- **Detective**: Finds threats (e.g., IDS, CCTV logs).
- **Corrective**: Fixes issues after attacks (e.g., restore backup).
- **Deterrent**: Makes attacker back off (e.g., warning signs).
- **Compensating**: Backup measure when others can’t apply (e.g., camera instead of MFA).

## NA-008 -9 Interesting security controls 
- **Mandatory Vacation**: Helps recognize if theres an insider among employees 
- **Job rotation**: periodically switching people around to work in different positions.
- **Multi-person control**: preventing a single person yo perform an action that could be bad. 
- **sepaaration of duties**: single individual should not participate in all duties across the board.(i.e security should do security, sales should do sales not intermixing).
