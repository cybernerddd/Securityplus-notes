# Week 2 – Day 1: Network Devices & Segmentation

## Firewalls
- Packet Filtering: Inspects packets without memory.
- Stateful: Tracks active sessions.
- NGFW: Filters by apps, behaviors, malware.
- Host-based vs Network-based firewalls.

## IDS vs IPS
- IDS: Detects & alerts. Passive.
- IPS: Detects & blocks. Active.

## VPN

- Types: Site-to-Site, Remote Access.

## Proxy Servers
- Forward Proxy: Controls outbound traffic.
- Reverse Proxy: Hides backend servers.
- Application Proxy: Filters by app type.

## Segmentation
- VLANs: Logical separation of network traffic.
- DMZ: Public zone separated from internal systems.
- Air Gap: No physical connection to external networks.
