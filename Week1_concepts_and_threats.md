# Week 1 - Threats & Security Concepts

## CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive info (e.g., encrypting data, strong passwords).
- **Integrity**: Ensure data hasnâ€™t been tampered with (e.g., hashing files, digital signatures).
- **Availability**: Make sure systems/data are always usable when needed (e.g., using RAID, generators, cloud backups).


## Threat Actors
- Script kiddies
- Hacktivists
- Nation-state actors
- Insider threats

## Types of Attacks
- Malware: Virus, Worm, Trojan
- Social Engineering: Phishing, Vishing, Pretexting
- Network Attacks: DDoS, MITM


## DAY 2 RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
--**Risk**: the potential to cause harm
- **Assests** : are tangible & intangible part of an infrastructure that provides benefits to the organization. And assest can be a computer or a server and can also be an employee. people can be assests 
- **Threat** : Is someone or something that can cause harm to our infrastructure. It can be a volcano or an earthquake or an unauthorized individual walking into the server room.
- **Vulnerability** : Is an open door in an asset that can be exploited. it can be open doors to a server room or an threat actor exploiting...
- **impact** : the damage at which a risk can hit
- Threats exploit vulnerabilities to harm assets
--- Threat * vulnerability = risk
