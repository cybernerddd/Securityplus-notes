# Week 1 - Threats & Security Concepts

##DAY 1 PURPOSE OF SECURITY- THE CIA TRIAD

## CIA Triad
- **Confidentiality**: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive info (e.g., encrypting data, strong passwords).
- **Integrity**: Ensure data hasn’t been tampered with (e.g., hashing files, digital signatures).
- **Availability**: Make sure systems/data are always usable when needed (e.g., using RAID, generators, cloud backups).


## Threat Actors
- Script kiddies : people with low knowledge, they hack systems with prebuilt tools. A good fire walling and good measures can stop them
- Hacktivists : Theyre intent and motivation is hat ou gotta know.
- Nation-state actors : Also known as Advanced Persistent threats(APTs), theyre well resourced groups that are directly or indirectly gunded by government to commit cyberattacks.
- Insider threats : This is not always an employee. it can be a claaner or a customer, anyone who comes into the infrastructure or works there.

## Types of Attacks
- Malware: Virus, Worm, Trojan
- Social Engineering: Phishing, Vishing, Pretexting
- Network Attacks: DDoS, MITM


## DAY 2 RISK AND RISK MANAGEMENT 
--**Risk**: the potential to cause harm
- **Assests** : are tangible & intangible part of an infrastructure that provides benefits to the organization. And assest can be a computer or a server and can also be an employee. people can be assests 
- **Threat** : Is someone or something that can cause harm to our infrastructure. It can be a volcano or an earthquake or an unauthorized individual walking into the server room.
- **Vulnerability** : Is an open door in an asset that can be exploited. it can be open doors to a server room or an threat actor exploiting...
- **impact** : the damage at which a risk can hit
- Threats exploit vulnerabilities to harm assets
--- Threat * vulnerability = risk 
!--- Go check up NIST SP 800-30 (talks about all threats and vulnerabilities a security could face)--


## Day 3 – Social Engineering

- **Phishing**: Fake emails/messages to trick users.
- **Spear Phishing**: Targeted phishing with personal info. Email from your boss or something.
- **Vishing**: Voice phishing.
- **Smishing**: SMS-based phishing.
- **Pretexting**: Attacker lies to get info.
- **Tailgating**: Following someone into a secure area.
- **Shoulder Surfing**: Watching people enter info.
- **Dumpster Diving**: Digging through trash for data.
